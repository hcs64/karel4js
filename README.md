karel4js
========

Barebones Karel interpreter in JavaScript.

Derived from _Karel the Robot_ by Richard E. Pattis (Second Edition revised by Jim Roberts and Mark Stehlik)


index.html (previously karel4.html) is the most complete. You can edit the initial conditions graphically, the program source is just text.
