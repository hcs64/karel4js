karel4js
========

Barebones Karel interpreter in JavaScript.

Derived from Karel the Robot by Richard E. Pattis, (second edition revised by Jim Roberts and Mark Stehlik)


karel4.html is the most complete, but there's not much to see. You can edit the initial conditions graphically, the program source is just text.
