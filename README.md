karel4js

Barebones Karel interpreter in JavaScript.

Derived from <u>Karel the Robot</u> (Second Edition) by Richard E. Pattis, Jim Roberts, and Mark Stehlik.


karel4.html is the most complete, but there's not much to see. You can edit the initial conditions graphically, the program source is just text.
